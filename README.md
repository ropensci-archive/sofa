__An easy interface to CouchDB from R__

Note: Check out [*R4couchdb*](https://github.com/wactbprot/R4CouchDB), another R
package to interact with CouchDB.

sofa docs: https://docs.ropensci.org/sofa/

## CouchDB versions

`sofa` works with CouchDB v2 and v3. See [the builds](https://github.com/ropensci/sofa/actions?query=workflow%3AR-check) for checks on various CouchDB versions.

## CouchDB Info

* Docs: <http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/index.html>
* Installation: <http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/install/index.html>

## Connect to CouchDB

This may be starting it on your terminal/shell

```sh
couchdb
```

Or opening the CouchDB app on your machine, or running it in Docker. Whatever it
is, start it up.

## Install sofa

From CRAN


```r
install.packages("sofa")
```

Development version from GitHub


```r
remotes::install_github("ropensci/sofa")
```


```r
library('sofa')
```

## Cushions

Cushions? What? Since it's couch we gotta use `cushions` somehow. `cushions` are a
connection class containing all connection info to a CouchDB instance.
See `?Cushion` for help.

As an example, connecting to a Cloudant couch:


```r
z <- Cushion$new(
  host = "stuff.cloudant.com",
  transport = 'https',
  port = NULL,
  user = 'foobar',
  pwd = 'things'
)
```

Break down of parameters:

* `host`: the base url, without the transport (`http`/`https`)
* `path`: context path that is appended to the end of the url
* `transport`: `http` or `https`
* `port`: The port to connect to. Default: 5984. For Cloudant, have to set to `NULL`
* `user`: User name for the service.
* `pwd`: Password for the service, if any.
* `headers`: headers to pass in all requests

If you call `Cushion$new()` with no arguments you get a cushion set up for local
use on your machine, with all defaults used.


```r
x <- Cushion$new()
```

Ping the server


```r
x$ping()
```

Nice, it's working.
